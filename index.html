    <p id="aboutme">Hello! My name is Nick. I am a 16 year old boy who loves to learn, play soccer, and spending time with my puppy. My life consists of working as a bagger at a grocery store, going to school, play soccer, and hanging out with my friends. I enjoy school and I just enjoy learning as a whole. I enjoy playing sports like football and soccer. I am really good at football but unfortunately Summit does not have a football team due to lack of funds. I believe that Summit could start a team but they are just too lazy. Football teams Enhance school spirit. </p>
